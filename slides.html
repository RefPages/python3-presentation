# Feature 1: Advanced unpacking

```py
>>> a, b, *rest = range(10)
>>> a
0
>>> b
1
>>> rest
[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
```

--

`*rest` can go anywhere:

```py
>>> a, *rest, b = range(10)
>>> a
0
>>> b
9
>>> rest
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
```

```py
>>> *rest, b = range(10)
>> rest
[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
>>> b
9
```

---

## Get the first and last lines of a file

```py
>>> with open("using_python_to_profit") as f:
...     first, *_, last = f.readlines()
>>> first
'Step 1: Use Python 3\n'
>>> last
'Step 10: Profit!\n'
```

--

## Refactor your functions

```py
def f(a, b, *args):
    stuff
```

```py
def f(*args):
    a, b, *args = args
    stuff
```

# Feature 2: Keyword only arguments

---

```py
def f(a, b, *args, option=True):
    ...
```

--

`option` comes *after* `*args`.

--

The only way to access it is to explicitly call `f(a, b, option=True)`

---

No more, "Oops, I accidentally passed too many arguments to the function, and
one of them was swalled by a keyword argument".

```py
def sum(a, b, biteme=False):
    if biteme:
        shutil.rmtree('/')
    else:
        return a + b
```

```
>>> sum(1, 2)
3
>>> sum(1, 2, 3)
<disaster>
```

---

Or, "I reordered the keyword arguments of a function, but something was
implicitly passing in arguments expecting the order"

Stupid example:

```py
def extendto(value, shorter, longer):
    """
    Extend list `shorter` to the length of list `longer` with `value`
    """
    if len(shorter) > len(longer):
        raise ValueError('The `shorter` list is longer than the `longer` list')
    a.extend([value]*(len(longer) - len(shorter)))
```

```py
>>> a = [1, 2]
>>> b = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> extendto(10, a, b)
>>> a
[1, 2, 10, 10, 10]
```

--

Hmm, maybe it makes more sense for `longer` to come before `shorter`...

Too bad, you'll break the code.

---

You can use

```py
def extendto(value, *, shorter=None, longer=None):
    """
    Extend list `shorter` to the length of list `longer` with `value`
    """
    if shorter is None or longer is None:
        raise TypeError('`shorter` and `longer` must be specified')
    if len(shorter) > len(longer):
        raise ValueError('The `shorter` list is longer than the `longer` list')
    a.extend([value]*(len(longer) - len(shorter)))
```

Now, `a` and `b` *have* to be passed in as `extendto(10, shorter=a,
longer=b)`.

--

Or if you prefer, `extendto(10, longer=b, shorter=a)`.

# Add new keyword arguments without breaking API.

- Python 3 did this in the standard library.

--

- For example, functions in `os` have `follow_symlinks` option.

--

- So you can just use `os.stat(file, follow_symlinks=False)` instead of `os.lstat`.

--

- Lets you do

  ```py
  s = os.stat(file, follow_symlinks=some_condition)
  ```

  instead of

  ```py
  if some_condition:
      s = os.stat(file)
  else:
      s = os.lstat(file)
  ```

--

- But `os.stat(file, some_condition)` doesn't work.

- Keeps you from thinking it's a two-argument function.

---

- In Python 2, you have to use `**kwargs` and do the handling yourself.

--

- Lot's of ugly `option = kwargs.pop(True)` at the top of your functions.

--

- No longer self documenting.
